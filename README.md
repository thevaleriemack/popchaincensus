# Popchain
a decentralized, extensible census



### Progressive Web Application
The Popchain website was built as a progressive web application (PWA) which enables compatibility with any web browser on both desktop computers and mobile phones.

### UPort Integration
We built our application using a Truffle Box boilerplate. This allows us to seamlessly integrate UPort digital identities for our authentication system.
